    "#Tree Data Structure Implementation in Python\n",
    "#What - A Tree Data Structure Is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. \n",
    "#     - It is used to represent relationships between elements\n",
    "#Why - Trees are used in various applications such as file systems, databases, and network routing. \n",
    "#     - They provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "#Time Complexity -\n",
    "#     - Insertion: O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) for unbalanced trees\n",
    "#     - Deletion: O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) for unbalanced trees\n",
    "#     - Searching: O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) for unbalanced trees\n",
    "\n",
    "#How - A tree consists of a root node, which is the topmost node,\n",
    "#      and child nodes that are connected to the root or other nodes. Each node can have zero or more child nodes.\n",
    "#      The connections between nodes are called edges.\n",
    "#\n",
    "\n",
    "#Traversal Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "#DFS\n",
    "# 1. Pre-order Traversal: Visit the root node first, then recursively traverse the left subtree, followed by the right subtree.\n",
    "# 2. In-order Traversal: Recursively traverse the left subtree, visit the root node, and then recursively traverse the right subtree.\n",
    "# 3. Post-order Traversal: Recursively traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally visit the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "#BFS\n",
    "# 4. Level-order Traversal: Visit nodes level by level, starting from the root and moving down to the leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#BFS vs DFS:\n",
    "# - BFS (Breadth-First Search) explores all the neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.\n",
    "#   It uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to visit.\n",
    "# - DFS (Depth-First Search) explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.\n",
    "#   It uses a stack data structure (or recursion) to keep track of nodes to visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic Terminology:\n",
    "# 1. Node: A fundamental unit of a tree that contains data and references to its child nodes.\n",
    "# 2. Root: The topmost node in a tree, which has no parent node.\n",
    "# 3. Parent: A node that has one or more child nodes connected to it.\n",
    "# 4. Child: A node that is connected to a parent node.\n",
    "# 5. Leaf: A node that has no child nodes.\n",
    "# 6. Sibling: Nodes that share the same parent node.\n",
    "# 7. Subtree: A tree formed by a node and all its descendants.\n",
    "# 8. Depth: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.\n",
    "# 9. Height: The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.\n",
    "# 10. Degree: The number of child nodes a node has.\n",
    "# 11. Path: A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node to its descendant.\n",
    "# 12. Ancestor: A node that is on the path from a given node to the root.\n",
    "# 13. Descendant: A node that is reachable from a given node by following child nodes.\n",
    "# 14. Balanced Tree: A tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.\n",
    "# Forest: A collection of disjoint trees.\n",
    "#Types of Trees: Below are some common types of trees used in computer science and data structures:\n",
    "# 1. General Tree: A tree where each node can have any number of child nodes.\n",
    "# 2. N-ary Tree: A tree where each node can have at most N child nodes.\n",
    "# 3. Binary Tree: A tree where each node has at most two child nodes.\n",
    "# 4. Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child node\n",
    "#     contains values less than the parent node, and the right child node contains values greater than the parent node.\n",
    "# 5. AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the\n",
    "#     two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.\n",
    "# 6. Red-Black Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where each node\n",
    "#     has an extra bit for denoting the color of the node, either red or black.\n",
    "# 7. Trie: A tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings\n",
    "#     where each node represents a character of a string.\n",
    "# 8. B-Tree: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data\n",
    "#     and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. It is commonly used in\n",
    "#     databases and file systems.\n",
    "# 9. B+ Tree: An extension of the B-Tree that maintains sorted data\n",
    "#     and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. In a B+ Tree\n",
    "#     all values are stored in the leaf nodes, while internal nodes only store keys to guide the search process.\n",
    "# 10. Splay Tree: A self-adjusting binary search tree that performs splaying\n",
    "#     - a tree restructuring operation that moves a specified node to the root of the tree.\n",
    "# 11. Segment Tree: A binary tree used for storing intervals or segments.\n",
    "#     It allows for efficient querying and updating of range-based data,\n",
    "#     such as finding the sum or minimum value within a specified range.\n",
    "# 12. Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree): A data structure that provides efficient methods\n",
    "#     for cumulative frequency tables or prefix sums. It allows for efficient updates and queries of cumulative\n",
    "#     frequencies in logarithmic time.\n",
    "# 13. K-D Tree (k-dimensional tree): A binary tree used for organizing points\n",
    "#     in a k-dimensional space. It is commonly used in applications such as nearest neighbor search\n",
    "#     and range queries.\n",
    "# 14. Octree: A tree data structure used for partitioning a three-dimensional space\n",
    "#     by recursively subdividing it into eight octants. It is commonly used in computer graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15. Quadtree: A tree data structure used for partitioning a two-dimensional space\n",
